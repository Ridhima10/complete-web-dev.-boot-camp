        //alert("This is a message");

        //2. Prompt in javascript-> It allows you to input the data. Here second value in parameter represents the placeholder message
        //let name=prompt("What is your name?","enter your name here...");

        //3. Confirm in javascript-> This is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.

        //let delpic=confirm("Do you want to del the picture?");
        //It returns "true" if you click ok and "false" if you click cancel 
        //console.log(delpic); 

        // you can also implement this using if-else statement
