// var a; //js will automatically allot memory to a as undefined bcz it is in the first phase now



var a = 7;
console.log(x); //not defined bcz x is not present


// console.log(a); //undefined bcz of hoisting
// a = 7;
// console.log(x) //not defined



// console.log(a); //undefined bcz of hoising 
// var a = 10;
// console.log(a); //10


// var a;
// console.log(a);
// if (a === undefined) {
//     console.log("it is undefined");
// }
// else {
//     console.log("It is not undefined");
// }


// it is loosely typed language which means we dont need to specify datatype while initializing
var a;
console.log(a)
a = 10;
console.log(a)
a = "hello";
console.log(a)

// also known as weakly typed language


a=undefined //it is not a good practice to assign undefined to a var becuase it has a special meaning moreover it will automatically assign undefined to a variable during the first phase so there is no need to assign.
