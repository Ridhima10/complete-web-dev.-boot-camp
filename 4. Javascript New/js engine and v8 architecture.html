    <p>Things learned:
        <ul>
            <li>
                 JS runtime environment contains all elements required to run JS.

            </li>
            <li>
It contains JS engine, set of API's, callback queue, microtask queue, event loop.
            </li>
            <li>
                 JS engine is a piece of code.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Process includes Parsing -> Compilation -> Execution.
            </li>
            <li>
         Parsing breaks code into tokens and converts it into AST(Abstract Syntax Tree).
            </li>
            <li>Modern JS engine follows JIT compilation, it interprets while it optimises code as much as it can.</li>
            <li>Execution and Compilation are done together.</li>
            <li>Execution has Garbage collector and other optimisation such as inlining, copy elusion, inline caching etc.</li>
        </ul>
